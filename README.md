# WP HTTP Blocklist

Block unwanted HTTP requests with a blocklist. 

When you manage platforms with WordPress with composer, it is sometimes penalizing to have all HTTP requests for update control.

For WordPress updates, you can use the very good [Disable All WordPress Updates](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-wordpress-updates/) plugin, but for other plugins, blocklist management seems more flexible :)

## Requirements

* WordPress > 4.4
* PHP > 5.6

## Customization and hooks

By default, you have a blocklist integrated into the plugin which will be gradually enriched.

You can add or modify the domains to block via the following hook / filter: "wp_http_blocklist" which transmits an array.

Example


```
<?php 
add_filter( 'wp_http_blocklist', function( $hosts ) {
	$hosts[] = 'blockthisdomain.com';

	return $hosts;
}, 10 );
```

## How to build your own blocklist?

Install the famous plugin [Log HTTP Requests](https://wordpress.org/plugins/log-http-requests/), and you will see all the external requests made by your platform.

You can also find these requests via plugins like [Query Monitor](https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) or APM services (ex: NewRelic)
