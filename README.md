# wp-http-blacklist

Block unwanted HTTP requests with a blacklist. 

When you manage platforms with WordPress with composer, it is sometimes penalizing to have all HTTP requests for update control.

For WordPress updates, you can use the very good "Disable All WordPress Updates" plugin, but for other plugins, blacklist management seems more flexible :)
